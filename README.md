# GWAS_WUE

We used GWAS-guided reverse genetics to identify effectors of water use efficiency (WUE). We measured WUE using gravimetric methods and carbon isotope composition (Î´13C) for mutants of candidate genes identified from GWAS WUE plasticity (Plasticity = drought-wet). Additionally, we measured stomatal density and leaf surface temperatures for these mutants. Please find the link for the published article of this study below:

All scripts used in this study for fitting linear mixed models, estimating marginal means, testing statistical significance, performing linear regression analysis, and data visualization are provided in this repository.

## Scripts Overview

### Code_Fig3
- **Purpose**: Used for data visualization (box plots) of the traits measured in this study. This script was used for generating Figures 3, 4, 5, and Supplemental Figure S6.

### Code_Figure2_V6
- **Purpose**: Used for linear regression analysis and data visualization related to Figure 2 in the manuscript.

### Code_LSmeans
- **Purpose**: This script fits linear mixed models, obtains estimated marginal means, and applies statistical tests on the obtained marginal means for mutants with planned contrasts at the gene and T-DNA levels versus Columbia.

### Code_FigS7
- **Purpose**: Used for T-tests on leaf surface temperature measurements and data visualization related to Supplemental Figure S7.
