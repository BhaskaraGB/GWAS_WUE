# GWAS_WUE: We used GWAS-guided reverse genetics to identify effectors of WUE. We measured WUE by gravimetric as well as carbon istopoe composition (13C) for the mutants of candidiate genes identified from GWAS WUE plasticity (Plasticity = drought-wet). In addition, stomatal density and leaf surface temperatures were also measured in this study.

Scripts use in this study for fitting linear mixed models, estimating marginal means, testing statistical signifacne, linear regression analysis and for data visualization are provided here.
