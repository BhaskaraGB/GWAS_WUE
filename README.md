# GWAS_WUE: We used GWAS-guided reverse genetics to identify effectors of WUE. We measured WUE by gravimetric as well as carbon istopoe composition (13C) for the mutants of candidiate genes identified from GWAS WUE plasticity (Plasticity = drought-wet). In addition, stomatal density and leaf surface temperatures were also measured for these mutants. The unpublished priprint of this study can be find here:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.28.486113v1. All scripts used in this study for fitting linear mixed models, estimating marginal means, testing statistical significance, linear regression analysis and data visualization are provided here.  
Code #Figure2_V6 was referred to the Figure 2 in the manuscript. This code was used for linear regression analysis and data visulization. 
Code#LSmeans: This code was used to fit linear mixed models, obtaining estimated marginal means and apply stastical tests on the obtained marginal means for mutants with planned contrasts at gene and T-DNA levels vs Columbia
