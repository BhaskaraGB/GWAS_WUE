# GWAS_WUE: We used GWAS-guided reverse genetics to identify effectors of WUE. We measured WUE by gravimetric as well as carbon istopoe composition (13C) for the mutants of candidiate genes identified from GWAS WUE plasticity (Plasticity = drought-wet). In addition, stomatal density and leaf surface temperatures were also measured for these mutants. The unpublished priprint of this study can be find here:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.28.486113v1. All scripts used in this study for fitting linear mixed models, estimating marginal means, testing statistical significance, linear regression analysis and data visualization are provided here.
