# GWAS_WUE: We used GWAS-guided reverse genetics to identify effectors of WUE. We measured WUE by gravimetric as well as carbon istopoe composition (13C) for the mutants of candidiate genes identified from GWAS WUE plasticity (Plasticity = drought-wet). In addition, stomatal density and leaf surface temperatures were also measured for these mutants.

All scripts used in this study for fitting linear mixed models, estimating marginal means, testing statistical significance, linear regression analysis and data visualization are provided here.  
Code #Figure2_V6: Referred to the Figure 2 in the manuscript. This code was used for linear regression analysis and data visulization. 
Code#LSmeans: This code was used to fit linear mixed models, obtaining estimated marginal means and apply stastical tests on the obtained marginal means for mutants with planned contrasts at gene and T-DNA levels vs Columbia
Code#FigS7: Referred to Supplemental Figure S7 that presents T-test for leaf surface temperature measurements and data visulization.
Code#Fig3: Referred to main figure 3. This code was used to for data visulization (box plots) for the traits measured in this study. The same script was used for Figures4-5 and FigS6.
